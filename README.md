▶️ How to Run the Project

Install Python 3 (if not installed)

Clone this repository or download the code

Save the file as:

maze_solver.py


Open terminal / command prompt inside the project folder

Run:

python maze_solver.py

🎮 How to Use

Adjust Rows and Columns using the sliders.

Choose solving algorithm:

DFS (Depth-First Search)

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Click ▶ Solve to start visualization.

Click 🔄 Reset to generate a new maze.

🧠 Algorithms Used
🔹 Depth-First Search (DFS)

Uses recursion.

Explores deeply before backtracking.

Does NOT guarantee shortest path.

🔹 Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Uses Queue (deque).

Explores level-by-level.

Always finds the shortest path (if one exists).

🧩 Maze Solver Visualizer
Interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer using Python & Tkinter

A visually engaging desktop application that demonstrates how classic pathfinding algorithms solve a maze in real-time. Built using Python and Tkinter, this project provides an interactive way to understand Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) through step-by-step visualization.

📌 Overview

The Maze Solver Visualizer generates a random maze and allows users to solve it using different search algorithms. The solving process is animated, making it ideal for learning algorithm behavior, recursion, and queue-based traversal.

This project is perfect for:

Students learning Data Structures & Algorithms

Beginners exploring GUI development

Academic demonstrations and presentations

✨ Key Features

🎨 Modern, dark-themed graphical interface

🧱 Random maze generation

📏 Adjustable maze dimensions (Rows & Columns)

🔎 Algorithm selection (DFS / BFS)

🎥 Real-time pathfinding animation

🟢 Start and 🔴 End node highlighting

🟡 Final path visualization

🔄 One-click maze reset

🚀 Installation & Execution
1️⃣ Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher installed

2️⃣ Run the Application
python maze_solver.py


No external libraries required. Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.

🎮 How to Use

Adjust maze Rows and Columns using sliders.

Select algorithm:

DFS (Depth-First Search)

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Click ▶ Solve to start visualization.

Click 🔄 Reset to generate a new maze.

🧠 Algorithms Implemented
🔹 Depth-First Search (DFS)

Uses recursion

Explores as far as possible before backtracking
